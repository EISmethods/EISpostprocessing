- the explicit methods eEIS+(2,4),eEIS+(4,4),eEIS+(3,6), and eEIS+(5,7) 
named eEIS2s4p.mat, eEIS4s4p.mat, eEIS3s6p.mat, and eEIS5s7p.mat
these files each contain the values:
s=number of stages, 
p=order, 
the abscissas c, 
the coefficient matrices D, A, R, 
and the truncation error vector tau

- the explicit SSP methods eSSP-EIS+(3,4) and eSSP-EIS+(4,5) named eSSPEIS3s4p.mat and eSSPEIS4s5p.mat
these files each contain the values above as well as the SSP coefficient Cssp.
